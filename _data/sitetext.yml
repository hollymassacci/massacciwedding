      - title: "Engagement"
        year: "January 2021"
        desc: "As they wrapped up the trip of a lifetime travelling around Tasmania they had a quiet night drinking Boags red on their
        friends farm in country Tassie. Steven took Holly out for a walk to see the most spectacular stars Holly had ever seen. They talked
        about their life and future together, reflected on the favourite moments from the trip and Steven spoke about how happy he is and said some
        beautiful things about the relationship and life they've built together when he got down on one knee and asked Holly to marry him. It was a 
        complete surprise to Holly (despite the fact that she accidentally found the ring box the week before) but was the easier yes of her life."
